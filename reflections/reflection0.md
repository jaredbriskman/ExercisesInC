# Reflection 0:

I came into this class knowing almost nothing about C, whih made it slightly hard to know where to go. Plenty of the deep dives are things which seem like they would be useful tangible skills to have, and most of the others just seem interesting on an intellectual level, so I'm sure I'll be happy whatever I do.

The synthesizer project seems well scoped and supported, as it has been done quite a few times before, and is particualrly geared towards learning C from scratch and being able to execute a simple, real project. This brought Ian, Margo, Joseph and I together, and we were all on the same page as to what we wanted. 

Within 5 minutes of sitting down, we had a github repo, slack channel, trello board and integrations between the three, because mmmmmm, agile software development. Ian was originally scrummaster, but as he dropped, I have taken up the role.

Right now we need to all dig in to HFC and ThinkOS to get to grips with the space and the tools, and towards the back half of the sprint we'll come together and define. Looking good.
